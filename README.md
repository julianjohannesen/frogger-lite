# Welcome to Frogger Lite!

## How to Play the Game

Use your keyboard's up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move your player around the screen. Your goal is to reach the water on the other side of the road (that's the top of your screen) without being run over by a busy bug!

Play the game here:

Or download the repository and use your browser to navigate to and open [index.html](index.html). The repository contains all of the files you'll need to play. 

## What is this

This game is a required project for Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodgree program. The original repo can be found  here:

[https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

To complete the project, students are required to provide a Player class and several methods in [app.js](js/app.js). Much of the code, including the [engine.js](js/engine.js) and [resource.js](js/resource.js) files were provided to students.

As it stands now, this is a minimal implementation.
